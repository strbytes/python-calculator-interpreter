Experimenting with a simple calculator interpreter that can evaluate one-line expressions with only primitive operators and numbers. Eventually I want to implement something like this in JavaScript and allow a user to enter expressions using a web mockup of a calculator, something like a TI-30. Currently working on how to parse an arithmetic expression with binary operators using the correct order of operations.
